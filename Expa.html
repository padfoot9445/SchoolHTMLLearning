                <p>Expa is a general-purpose scripting-language with a speciality in command-style event-handling. It is unique in that it saves its state between runs&nbsp;-&nbsp;being, at its core, a command-language, this was neccesary to track jobs.</p>
                <p>The idea of Expa was introduced as part of V2 of <a href="nostars-expansion-tracker.html">Nostars Expansion Tracker</a>, but was scrapped from the release. the scrapped Nostars Expansion Tracker V3 was an early implementation of Expa, however, due to various maintainability issues it was discontinued before release. The current language under development is Expa V2, or Nostars-Expansion-Tracker V4.</p>

            <p>Expa-IL is a custom bytecode specification made for Expa. In addition to your typical arithmetic and logical operators, many abstractions are implemented as opcodes, and db-access is also impelemented. Expa-IL is interpreted, and hosted in c#, but as of yet there has not been any performance issues.</p>
